> It was learning experience for me as I got to learn so many new things like :

 - Socket.io

 - transaction between react and express
 - some concepts of NODE.JS

 2. Node.js
 3. Socket.io
 4. cors [ solve the problem related to cross-origin resource sharing ]
 5. nodemon [ to make hot reloads ]

For Client side:

 1. Reactjs
 2. react-router-dom
 3. react-emoji [for adding emoji ]

Hosted on:
